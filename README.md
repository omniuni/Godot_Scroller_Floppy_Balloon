# Godot Pong - "Gong"

**Version:** 0.5

## Description

A simple physics-based Pong game written in Godot.

This is designed to be an example project, demonstrating a lot of the basics required to make a game in Godot, as well as some interesting and useful features. I'm sure there are better ways to do some of this, and the code could be cleaner, but I hope that it will still serve as a good starting point for newcomers.

The game runs at a fixed pixel density with integer scaling.

There are minimal external assets. Just one font, and one sound file.

All of the shapes and UI in the game are made with Godot tooling, and the variety of different sounds come from manipulating the single audio tone.

There are also examples of physics manipulation with the integrator, dynamic UI elements using the `@tool` annotation, autoload singletons for settings, and reusable scenes.

I also tried to keep the project organized in a way that makes sense, and navigation is handled with a utility to simplify adding and renaming scenes.

This is published under the GPL, so feel free to do what you want with it. If you find it helpful, I'd appreciate a call-out in an about dialog, but it's not necessary.

## To-Do

The code has some basic comments, but it could be better.
